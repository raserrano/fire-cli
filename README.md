# fire-cli
Financial independence retire early calculator/tracker for CLI  


## DB
Will try to use lightweight local db called [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)

The idea is to have this application exist only on the CLI. Charts generation, data input and #YourMorneyOrYourLife wall chart style graph.

## Charts
Will implement charts on the CLIusing [asciichart](https://github.com/kroitor/asciichart)

## Tests 
Usage of CucucumberJS to test everything and document.
